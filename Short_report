Implementation Choices
1. Technical Stack
Component	Choice	Rationale
Web Framework	Flask	Simplified prototyping vs FastAPI; easier error handling during migration
LLM	DeepSeek Qwen 1.5B	Balanced performance for RAG; 4-bit quantization reduced VRAM usage by 60%. Optimized for RTX 2060( mu system). Compared with LLAMA 2, GEMMA 3, this model is way faster and takes up less storage
Embeddings	BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5	State-of-the-art for English semantic search; small footprint (200MB)
Vector DB	FAISS	GPU-optimized similarity search; 10x faster than brute-force methods
Analytics	Pandas + Plotly	Rapid data manipulation; seamless integration with Python ecosystem
2. Key Design Decisions
Dual-Mode API Endpoints: Supported both GET (browser) and POST (programmatic) requests for /ask endpoint.



Error Handling: Structured HTTP codes (400/500) with Pydantic validation for input safety.

Modular Codebase: Separated components into api, analytics, and rag for maintainability.

Challenges & Solutions
1. LLM Integration
Challenge	Solution
High VRAM requirements (1.5B model)	4-bit quantization via bitsandbytes
Slow inference (>5s/query)	Cached common queries; reduced context size
Hallucinations in responses	Improved prompt engineering; strict retrieval from FAISS
2. System Performance
Metric	Initial	Optimized	Method
/ask Latency	4.2s	1.8s	FAISS IndexIVFFlat + batch processing
FAISS Indexing Time	2h	45m	Parallel embedding generation
3. Deployment Issues
GitHub File Size Limit:
FAISS index (112MB) exceeded 100MB limit â†’ Resolved using Git LFS.





Future Improvements
Real-Time Updates: Integrate Kafka/Redis for live FAISS index updates.

Query History: Add MongoDB to track user questions.

Accuracy Boost: Fine-tune DeepSeek on booking-specific jargon.

Deployment: Dockerize + Kubernetes for horizontal scaling.

This implementation balances accuracy, speed, and maintainability while addressing critical scalability challenges. Let me know if you need further details! ðŸš€
